I was introduced to the concept of Design Thinking by my long time friend [Samina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samina/), Design Strategist@[Tinker Labs](http://www.tinkerlabs.in/), a few years back. When I first heard the term, I was kinda confused as to why this is so important these days(A simple google search brings back around 1.5 billion search results), why startups, MBA colleges, and in-fact giants like [Uber](https://medium.com/uber-design/how-we-design-on-the-ubereats-team-ff7c41fffb76), [Airbnb](https://www.bbva.com/en/airbnb-design-thinking-success-story/) etc everyone is talking about design thinking. This got me hooked and made me delve to understand what it actually means. The more I learnt about Design Thinking, the more I realised this is one of the core concepts which should be kept close to heart when designing new products. You may ask why? 

# What is design Thinking?
Before going into the journey of explaining why I chose to write this blog highlighting Design Thinking, I want to first take some time to explain what exactly is design thinking. I would like to start by quoting [Tim Brown’s](https://designthinking.ideo.com/) definition of design thinking: 

> Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

So far so good. Let’s break down this definition into some core terms - “human-centric approach”, “needs of people”, possibilities of technology and “business success”. If we look closely into the above highlighted words, Design Thinking can be understood as in layman’s terms as **a process to deliver user- focussed solutions, while ideating and exploring all possibilities, thereby resulting in solutions fostering business success and engaged customers.** 

Design Thinking is not something new(stay tuned for a later post on this), its core principles and ideas have been there helping us throughout decades . But now that we have a clearer understanding of Design thinking, lets breakdown Design Thinking into its various stages(as proposed by [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/)):
- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype 
- Test

Let’s take a step back, and look back at the definition of Design Thinking again - the various stages actually just articulate the core definition.

# So the question why am I talking about design thinking today?

Wearing the hat of a Product Manager and CTO in my various roles, one of the key aspects of my day-to-day job is to ensure we can iterate fast, and deliver products which not only interest and excite our customers, but also solve their problems. I feel like if we group different products which we come across everyday, we can classify them into one of the two categories below:
- Improving on the existing experience
- Creating a new experience 

Customer Experience in today's world is the single most important thing while building great products. A single change in user experience in [Snapchat](https://www.themarketingscope.com/snapchat-user-experience/) caused the stock to drop over 6.1% or 1.3 billion dollars in market value. A product manager needs to keep the customer problem space and experience at its heart, while building customer facing products, otherwise soon their products are a recipe for disaster. If we look at the key dimensions which product managers need to possess while building great products - these can be categorized as:
- Knowledge - Knowing the market and customer needs
- Ideation - Putting themselves into user’s shoes, and imagining something amazing to solve their needs
- Conviction - Pushing beyond boundaries, building the product, and achieving buy-in

These three dimensions not only have a striking similarity to Design Thinking, but also a huge overlap. As a design thinker you will care about customer empathy, feasibility and practicality. The beauty of Design Thinking is that it helps us to trigger our creative instincts by asking why([Five Why’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)) and framing the right problem statements. Problem finding and problem definition is where a good design thinker and a product manager should spend the most time.


Having these design thinking skills coupled with analyticals skills enforces us to be successful PM’s. In early stages of products, how many times have your heard PM’s focussing on user-centric metrics like Net Promoter Score ([NPS](https://www.netpromoter.com/know/)) or customer satisfaction ratings as their north star? Using such metrics is not only very important when building products catered towards user-engagement, but also helps in gauging user interest and hinting user needs.
